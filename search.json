    "text": "Few positions on an NFL team take more heat than the kicker.\nMany games have been decided by one monumental field goal try in the last few minutes of the game. As a Bears fan, I know well enough that a kicker can seemingly make or break a season, but how important are their points to the season as a whole?\nThe following visualizations examine this exact question and demonstrate how circumstance may cause kickers to take more blame than they should for the outcomes of their seasons. I will specifically be looking at the 2024 NFC, as kickers played a significant role.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\n\nX2024KICKING &lt;- read_csv(\"data/2024KICKING.csv\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Team = case_when(\n    Team == \"DAL\" ~ \"Dallas Cowboys\",\n    Team == \"PIT\" ~ \"Pittsburgh Steelers\",\n    Team == \"LAC\" ~ \"Los Angeles Chargers\",\n    Team == \"HOU\" ~ \"Houston Texans\",\n    Team == \"MIA\" ~ \"Miami Dolphins\",\n    Team == \"LVR\" ~ \"Las Vegas Raiders\",\n    Team == \"IND\" ~ \"Indianapolis Colts\",\n    Team == \"PHI\" ~ \"Philadelphia Eagles\",\n    Team == \"LAR\" ~ \"Los Angeles Rams\",\n    Team == \"ATL\" ~ \"Atlanta Falcons\",\n    Team == \"DEN\" ~ \"Denver Broncos\",\n    Team == \"SFO\" ~ \"San Francisco 49ers\",\n    Team == \"NWE\" ~ \"New England Patriots\",\n    Team == \"TAM\" ~ \"Tampa Bay Buccaneers\",\n    Team == \"ARI\" ~ \"Arizona Cardinals\",\n    Team == \"NOR\" ~ \"New Orleans Saints\",\n    Team == \"SEA\" ~ \"Seattle Seahawks\",\n    Team == \"MIN\" ~ \"Minnesota Vikings\",\n    Team == \"WAS\" ~ \"Washington Commanders\",\n    Team == \"BAL\" ~ \"Baltimore Ravens\",\n    Team == \"BUF\" ~ \"Buffalo Bills\",\n    Team == \"DET\" ~ \"Detroit Lions\",\n    Team == \"JAX\" ~ \"Jacksonville Jaguars\",\n    Team == \"CLE\" ~ \"Cleveland Browns\",\n    Team == \"CAR\" ~ \"Carolina Panthers\",\n    Team == \"KAN\" ~ \"Kansas City Chiefs\",\n    Team == \"CHI\" ~ \"Chicago Bears\",\n    Team == \"TEN\" ~ \"Tennessee Titans\",\n    Team == \"CIN\" ~ \"Cincinnati Bengals\",\n    Team == \"GNB\" ~ \"Green Bay Packers\",\n    Team == \"NYG\" ~ \"New York Giants\",\n    Team == \"NYJ\" ~ \"New York Jets\"))\nnfc_2024 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/2024NFC.csv\")\ncolnames(nfc_2024)[colnames(nfc_2024) == \"Tm\"] &lt;- \"Team\"\nnfc_2024 &lt;- nfc_2024 |&gt;\n  mutate(Team = gsub(\"[*+]\", \"\", Team) |&gt; trimws())\n\nnfc_kicking_2024 &lt;- left_join(X2024KICKING, nfc_2024, by = \"Team\") |&gt;\n  filter(Team %in% nfc_2024$Team)  |&gt;\n  filter(`FG%` &gt; 1)\n\nggplot(nfc_kicking_2024, aes(x = `FG%`, y = `W-L%`)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"red\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Field Goal Percentage\",\n    y = \"Win-Loss Percentage\",\n    title = \"Kicker Accuracy Compared to Overall Team Win-Loss Percentage\",\n    subtitle = \"Does Having an Accurate Kicker Guarantee More Wins?\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a kicker “makes or breaks” the season, then the teams with the most accurate kickers should cluster toward the top of the graph. But that is not the reality. In fact, this graph demonstrates that there is little correlation at all between an accurate kicker and a winning team.\nWe can also see that a shaky kicker doesn’t automatically ruin a season. Even the teams with less accurate kickers have better win-loss percentages than teams with significantly more accurate feet behind the ball.\nBut that can’t be right? Thousands of screens across America have been turned off in stunned silence after a missed field goal. The reverberations of the ball off the uprights has caused football fans everywhere to lose sleep.\nLet’s try another visual, this time looking at how many points the kickers are responsible for in comparison to the rest of the team.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\nnfc_kicking_2024 &lt;- nfc_kicking_2024 |&gt;\n  mutate(kicker_PTS = FGM_total * 3,\nother_PTS = TeamPts - kicker_PTS)\n\n\nnfc_long &lt;- nfc_kicking_2024 |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(other_PTS,kicker_PTS),\n    names_to = \"Points_Type\",\n    values_to = \"Points\")\n\nggplot(nfc_long, aes(x = reorder(Team, TeamPts), y = Points, fill = Points_Type)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"kicker_PTS\" = \"red\", \"other_PTS\" = \"dodgerblue\"),\n                    labels = c(\"Kicker Points\", \"Other Points\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Kicker Contribution to Team Points\", x = \"Team\", y = \"Points\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we can see that kickers contributed a fairly consistent amount of points across NFC teams in the 2024 season. It is clear that the majority of points scored are coming from offensive players but this graph also tells another interesting story.\nThat low scoring chunk of teams all have kickers that scored about the same amount as the high scoring teams, meaning teams that have a less effective offense rely more on their kickers to score them points. Inversely, the higher scoring teams don’t have smaller amounts of kicker points which shows that even elite offenses lean on their kicker to finish drives.\n\n\nCode\nnfc_kicking_2024 &lt;- nfc_kicking_2024 |&gt;\n  mutate(kicker_pct = (kicker_PTS / TeamPts) * 100) |&gt;\n  filter(FGA_total &gt; 20)\n\nteam_colors &lt;- c(\n  \"Dallas Cowboys\" = \"#003594\",\n  \"Philadelphia Eagles\" = \"#004C54\",\n  \"Washington Commanders\" = \"#5A1414\",\n  \"New York Giants\" = \"#0B2265\",\n  \"Detroit Lions\" = \"#0076B6\",\n  \"Minnesota Vikings\" = \"#4F2683\",\n  \"Green Bay Packers\" = \"#203731\",\n  \"Chicago Bears\" = \"#0B162A\",\n  \"Tampa Bay Buccaneers\" = \"#D50A0A\",\n  \"New Orleans Saints\" = \"#D3BC8D\",\n  \"Atlanta Falcons\" = \"#A71930\",\n  \"Carolina Panthers\" = \"#0085CA\",\n  \"San Francisco 49ers\" = \"#AA0000\",\n  \"Los Angeles Rams\" = \"#003594\",\n  \"Seattle Seahawks\" = \"#002244\",\n  \"Arizona Cardinals\" = \"#97233F\")\n\nggplot(nfc_kicking_2024, aes(x = kicker_pct, y = SRS, size = kicker_PTS, color = Team)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.8) +\n  geom_text_repel(aes(label = Team), hjust = 1.1, vjust = 0.5, size = 3) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = team_colors, labels = nfc_kicking_2024$Team) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Kicker Contribution vs Team Strength (SRS)\",\n    x = \"% of Team Points from Kicker\",\n    y = \"SRS (Team Strength)\",\n    size = \"Kicker Points\",\n    color = \"Kicker\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, you can see the Cowboys have a strong kicker based on points scored, however, that kicker is responsible for almost 35% of his teams’ points. Even the best kicker in the world cannot make up for a lack of scoring by the rest of his team. The Lions are a display of how overall team strength is affected when both the kicker and the offense do their jobs in running up the score."
